# Taylor series and their applications
Taylor series are a powerful tool in mathematics and engineering, allowing us to approximate functions using polynomials. They are particularly useful for analyzing the behavior of functions near a specific point, known as the expansion point.
We will use Taylors theorem to analyze stationary points of functions and to derive the Taylor series expansion of a function.
