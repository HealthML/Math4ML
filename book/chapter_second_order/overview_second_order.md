# Second-Order Calculus and Optimization

Second-order derivatives provide crucial information about function curvature and local behavior. We develop the mathematical framework for second-order analysis, derive necessary and sufficient conditions for local minima using the Hessian matrix, and then leverage this foundation to build powerful second-order optimization algorithms.
