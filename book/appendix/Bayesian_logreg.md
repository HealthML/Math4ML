# Bayesian Logistic Regression with Variational Inference

## üåü Motivation

Classification tasks are everywhere‚Äîspam filtering, image classification, medical diagnosis, and beyond. Traditional logistic regression gives us clear, interpretable classification boundaries, but there's a critical limitation: **uncertainty** isn't captured. How confident are we about predictions away from our data points? Can we quantify this uncertainty?

**Bayesian logistic regression** answers these questions beautifully by modeling uncertainty directly in our predictions. However, performing exact Bayesian inference is often impossible. To address this, we turn to **Variational Inference (VI)**‚Äîa powerful, scalable approach for approximate Bayesian inference:

* VI enables practical Bayesian modeling, even in cases when exact methods (like Markov Chain Monte Carlo) become computationally prohibitive.
* It provides principled uncertainty estimates alongside predictive means.
* It uses optimization techniques you're familiar with (gradient ascent) to approximate complex posterior distributions.

---

## üìå What You Will Do in This Project

Your clear goal is:

> **Implement Bayesian Logistic Regression using Variational Inference (VI)** and apply it to the classic nonlinear "two moons" classification dataset.

Specifically, you'll:

* Implement a diagonal-Gaussian variational approximation $q(\mathbf{w})$ for logistic regression.
* Derive and maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (**ELBO**) using **stochastic gradient ascent**.
* Visualize clearly the Bayesian decision boundary and predictive uncertainty across the data space.

---

## üîç Key Concepts You'll Master

Throughout this project, you'll gain hands-on experience and deep understanding of:

* **Bayesian Classification**:
  Moving beyond deterministic decision boundaries toward probability distributions over parameters and predictions.

* **Variational Inference (VI)**:
  Learning how to approximate difficult posterior distributions with simpler families (diagonal Gaussians) by maximizing the ELBO.

* **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**:
  Understanding ELBO as a powerful and intuitive objective balancing data likelihood and model complexity.

* **Re-parameterization trick**:
  Using this key computational trick to efficiently compute gradients for your stochastic gradient ascent.

---

## üöß Core Tasks (Implementation Details)

You will concretely engage with these tasks:

* **ELBO Derivation**:
  Derive clearly (with your own steps) the ELBO objective for Bayesian logistic regression with a Gaussian variational posterior.

* **Stochastic Gradient Ascent Implementation**:
  Implement gradient-based optimization (e.g., using minibatches) to efficiently maximize your ELBO and approximate the true posterior distribution.

* **Visualization**:
  Plot clearly the learned Bayesian decision boundary, and also visualize predictive uncertainty (entropy) across your feature space.

---

## üìù Reporting: Analysis and Insights

Your brief (\~2 pages) report should include clear comparisons and intuitive insights:

* **Deterministic vs. Bayesian Boundaries**:
  Clearly compare standard logistic regression to Bayesian logistic regression decision boundaries, highlighting key differences.

* **Uncertainty Visualization**:
  Discuss explicitly how predictive uncertainty (entropy) varies away from training data, emphasizing why this matters practically.

* **Insights into ELBO optimization**:
  Briefly discuss how the ELBO changes during optimization and how the posterior uncertainty evolves.

---

## üöÄ Stretch Goals (Optional, Advanced)

If you're eager for additional depth, you might:

* Move beyond diagonal covariance, implementing a **low-rank plus diagonal full covariance** variational posterior.
* Compare your VI-based Bayesian logistic regression against a **Laplace approximation**, discussing practical trade-offs in computational complexity and quality of uncertainty estimates.

---

## üìö Resources and Support

* Starter notebooks will be provided, including synthetic "two moons" data and basic visualization tools to help you focus on core VI implementation.
* You may use external resources, lecture notes, and clearly documented AI-assisted tools in your implementation.

---

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

This project positions you at the forefront of practical Bayesian machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques:

* VI is widely used for scalable Bayesian modeling in industry and academia‚Äîacross fields such as NLP, computer vision, healthcare, and finance.
* Understanding and implementing Bayesian logistic regression with VI equips you with practical experience, highly valued by industry and research groups.
* You'll create a visually intuitive and analytically insightful piece, perfect for your portfolio.
