# Gaussian Mixture Models with EM

## üåü Motivation

Imagine you're given data that clearly doesn't come from a single Gaussian distribution. Instead, it forms multiple clusters, each with distinct shapes, sizes, and orientations. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)** provide a flexible, probabilistic approach for modeling exactly this type of complex data.

GMMs are widely used across machine learning tasks, including:

* **Clustering**: Grouping data points into meaningful sub-populations.
* **Density estimation**: Understanding underlying data structure in a probabilistic manner.
* **Anomaly detection**: Identifying unusual data points based on probabilities.

To fit a GMM, you'll use a powerful iterative procedure known as **Expectation-Maximization (EM)**, which neatly handles missing information‚Äîhere, the assignment of data points to Gaussian components.

## üìå What You Will Do in This Project

Your core goal is clear:

> **Fit a 2-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model using the EM algorithm**, visualizing clearly how your model converges.

In this project you'll implement from scratch (using NumPy only):

* A **Gaussian Mixture Model** with **3 to 5 Gaussian components**.
* The full **Expectation-Maximization algorithm**, alternating between soft cluster assignments and Gaussian parameter updates.
* A visualization tool to clearly show how your algorithm refines the clusters step-by-step.

---

## üîç Key Concepts You'll Master

This project introduces you to several foundational ideas in probabilistic machine learning:

* **Soft clustering** (E-step):
  Unlike k-means (hard assignment), EM assigns data points to clusters probabilistically, capturing uncertainty explicitly.

* **Closed-form parameter updates** (M-step):
  You'll derive and implement exact, analytic updates for means, covariances, and cluster weights.

* **Numerical stability (log-sum-exp trick)**:
  Real-world implementations require care to avoid numerical underflow when computing probabilities. You'll learn and apply the log-sum-exp trick.

---

## üöß Core Tasks (Implementation Details)

You'll follow these practical steps:

* **Expectation Step (E-step)**: Compute posterior probabilities (soft assignments) that each data point belongs to each cluster.
* **Maximization Step (M-step)**: Analytically update the means, covariances, and mixture weights from these probabilities.
* **Convergence and Visualization**: Track the log-likelihood of the data under your model each iteration.

  * Plot the **2-sigma covariance ellipses** of each Gaussian component every 5 iterations.
  * Observe how the components shift and reshape to fit the data.

Your implementation will show clearly how EM iteratively increases the likelihood and refines cluster boundaries.

## üìù Reporting: Analysis and Insights

Your short report (\~2 pages) should clearly document:

* **Log-likelihood evolution**: Plot the log-likelihood at each iteration to demonstrate monotonic convergence.
* **Discussion of convergence**: Identify local optima and discuss strategies to mitigate this (e.g., initialization strategies or multiple runs).
* **Visualization interpretation**: Explain how and why the Gaussian components change during EM.

---

## üöÄ Stretch Goals (Optional, Advanced)

To further enrich your understanding, you might:

* **Implement Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**: Automatically determine the best number of clusters (K).
* **Explore initialization methods**: Compare random initialization to k-means initialization and discuss impacts on convergence and quality.

---

## üìö Resources and Support

* You're encouraged to use open-source references, lecture notes, and AI tools (clearly documented).
* A starter notebook with synthetic datasets will be provided, allowing you to focus primarily on the EM implementation and visualizations.

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

Beyond contributing significantly to your final grade, mastering GMMs and EM:

* Strengthens your foundational knowledge of probabilistic modeling and inference‚Äîcore topics in modern ML.
* Provides practical experience with numerical stability and robust algorithm implementation.
* Equips you with visualization and analysis skills valued both academically and in industry.

This project is an opportunity to build robust ML intuition and coding skills applicable to a broad range of real-world challenges.
