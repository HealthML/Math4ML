# Comparison of Kernel Functions in SVM Classification

## üåü Motivation

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) rely heavily on kernel functions to transform data into higher-dimensional spaces where it becomes easier to separate classes linearly. Different kernels provide different mappings and impact the classifier‚Äôs performance, complexity, and generalization.

This project explores:

- How various kernel functions affect SVM classification.
- The mathematical intuition behind kernel transformations.

## üìå What You Will Do in This Project

> **Implement or use an existing SVM classifier and compare its performance with multiple kernels on a standard classification dataset.**

You will:

- Train SVM models with different kernel functions:
  - Linear kernel
  - Polynomial kernel (with varying degrees)
  - Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel
  - (Optional) Sigmoid or custom kernels
- Analyze the mathematical effect of kernels on data transformation and decision boundaries.
- Evaluate classification accuracy and computational aspects.
- Discuss pros and cons of each kernel in practice.

---

## üîç Key Concepts You'll Master

- Kernel trick and feature space transformations
- SVM decision functions and margin maximization
- Properties of linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid kernels

---

## üöß Core Tasks (Implementation Details)

- Select a suitable dataset (e.g., UCI Iris or Breast Cancer).
- Train SVM classifiers using scikit-learn‚Äôs `SVC` with specified kernels.
- For polynomial kernels, vary the degree parameter and observe effects.
- Measure and compare classification accuracy, training time, and model complexity.
- Visualize decision boundaries for 2D feature subsets (if possible).
- Provide mathematical explanation of each kernel‚Äôs transformation.

## üìù Reporting: Analysis and Insights

Your report (~2 pages) should include:

- Theoretical overview of kernel functions and their effects.
- Quantitative comparison of accuracy and computational cost.
- Visualizations of decision boundaries.
- Discussion of when to prefer each kernel based on data characteristics and task requirements.
