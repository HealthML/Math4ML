# Gaussian-Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) with Input Optimisation

## üåü Motivation

Real-world data often lies on complex, curved surfaces or manifolds in a high-dimensional space. Think of images, speech signals, or biological measurements: although high-dimensional, they typically possess a much simpler underlying structure. Can we automatically discover such a simplified, low-dimensional structure from complex data?

A powerful solution to this question is the **Gaussian-Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM)**:

* GPLVM elegantly extends Gaussian Processes to **unsupervised learning**, automatically discovering low-dimensional representations.
* It reveals the intrinsic structure hidden in high-dimensional observations by optimising latent input positions.
* It outperforms linear methods (like PCA) in capturing nonlinear relationships and structure.

In short: GPLVM helps you "unroll" complex manifolds, simplifying data representation and interpretation.

## üìå What You Will Do in This Project

Your main goal is straightforward yet powerful:

> **Implement a Gaussian-Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM)** to find a meaningful 2-D latent representation of the classic **3-D Swiss-roll dataset**.

You will:

* Implement GPLVM from scratch, using NumPy.
* Optimise latent variables (input points in latent space) and kernel hyperparameters simultaneously.
* Visualise your learned latent embedding clearly to show how GPLVM uncovers the underlying 2-D structure hidden in the data.

---

## üîç Key Concepts You'll Master

Through this project, you'll build practical skills around these key ideas:

* **Latent Variable Modelling**:
  Understanding how latent inputs (unobserved) can be optimised to explain complex observed data effectively.

* **GP Marginal Likelihood and MAP**:
  You'll learn how the marginal likelihood of Gaussian Processes guides simultaneous optimisation of latent variables and kernel hyperparameters.

* **Alternating Optimisation**:
  Discover how to iteratively optimise latent inputs and kernel parameters to reveal meaningful low-dimensional representations.

* **Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction**:
  Compare how GPLVM performs better than linear methods (PCA), providing more interpretable embeddings.

---

## üöß Core Tasks (Implementation Details)

You will practically engage with these tasks:

* **Latent Initialisation (PCA)**:
  Begin by initialising latent 2-D positions for your data points using PCA, providing a sensible starting point.

* **Alternating Optimisation**:
  Perform iterative optimisation steps, alternating between:

  * Optimising **latent inputs (X)**.
  * Optimising **kernel hyperparameters** (length-scale, signal variance, noise variance).

* **Visualization**:
  Create clear visualisations of your latent embedding (2-D space) colour-coded by the height of the original Swiss-roll, showing clearly how GPLVM effectively ‚Äúunrolls‚Äù the manifold.

## üìù Reporting: Analysis and Insights

Your short report (\~2 pages) should focus on insightful comparisons and explanations:

* Clearly explain why GPLVM provides a more meaningful embedding than PCA for nonlinear data like the Swiss-roll.
* Visually illustrate your embedding, highlighting key structural features and smoothness of the learned representation.
* Briefly discuss how optimising both inputs and kernel parameters leads to more powerful dimensionality reduction.

---

## üöÄ Stretch Goals (Optional, Advanced)

If you're keen to explore further, you might:

* Implement **back-constraints**: add parametric mappings to better generalise to new data points.
* Compare GPLVM embedding to other nonlinear methods such as **t-SNE**, highlighting differences in interpretability and manifold preservation.

---

## üìö Resources and Support

* Starter code for data generation (Swiss-roll) and visualisation will be provided, enabling you to focus on the core GPLVM implementation.
* Feel free to leverage external resources, lecture notes, and clearly documented AI-assistance.

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

GPLVM is not just a fascinating theoretical concept; it‚Äôs highly practical and valuable in real-world contexts:

* Widely used in fields such as bioinformatics, robotics, computer vision, and data visualization.
* Provides deep intuition into nonlinear dimensionality reduction, latent-variable modeling, and Gaussian processes‚Äîcrucial topics in modern machine learning.
* Demonstrates your ability to implement complex probabilistic models, optimally position latent variables, and interpret sophisticated models visually and mathematically.

This project is an opportunity to create a standout portfolio piece and gain robust understanding and confidence in modern nonlinear probabilistic modeling.
