# Gaussian Processes with Kernel Optimization

## üåü Motivation

When dealing with regression problems, you've often fitted simple linear models. But real-world data can be much more complex, nonlinear, and uncertain. How can we model such complexities accurately, while also quantifying our uncertainty about predictions?

**Gaussian Processes (GP)** offer a powerful Bayesian approach for regression that directly addresses these questions:

* They elegantly combine flexibility and simplicity, offering a **fully probabilistic framework**.
* GPs naturally quantify uncertainty, clearly indicating how confident we are in our predictions.
* Kernel functions give us a powerful way to control the smoothness and complexity of our model, adapting automatically to data.

This project will give you practical experience building a GP regression model from scratch, using NumPy, and show how to optimize hyperparameters to fit data robustly.

## üìå What You Will Do in This Project

Your clear, achievable goal is:

> **Implement a 1-D Gaussian Process regression model with an RBF kernel**, optimizing hyperparameters via marginal likelihood maximization.

In this hands-on project, you'll:

* Code from scratch the GP **predictive mean and variance** calculations using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.
* Implement a numerical optimization procedure (L-BFGS or simple grid search) to optimize hyperparameters:

  * **length-scale** $\ell$,
  * **signal variance** $\sigma_f^2$,
  * **noise variance** $\sigma_n^2$.
* Clearly visualize your fitted GP model predictions with ¬±2œÉ uncertainty bands for increasing numbers of training samples (n = 5, 10, 30).

## üîç Key Concepts You'll Master

Through this project, you'll gain practical mastery of several important concepts:

* **Gaussian Processes fundamentals**:
  How GP regression works as a Bayesian method, providing predictive distributions, not just single predictions.

* **Kernel hyperparameter optimization**:
  Learn how to objectively tune your kernel parameters ($\ell,\sigma_f,\sigma_n$) by maximizing the **marginal likelihood (evidence)**.

* **Numerical Stability and Efficiency**:
  Implement the Cholesky decomposition method for stable and efficient GP inference and optimization.

* **Uncertainty quantification**:
  Clearly visualize prediction uncertainty and understand its importance in real-world decision-making.

---

## üöß Core Tasks (Implementation Details)

You'll proceed with these practical steps:

* **RBF kernel implementation**:
  Code up a clean and efficient RBF kernel in NumPy.

* **GP predictive equations**:
  Compute the GP posterior mean and variance predictions from training data, clearly handling numerical stability (Cholesky solves and log-determinants).

* **Hyperparameter optimization**:
  Use an optimizer (`scipy.optimize` or grid search) to find the best kernel hyperparameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood (evidence).

* **Visualization of Uncertainty**:
  Clearly plot your GP predictions with ¬±2œÉ confidence intervals for different amounts of training data (n = 5, 10, 30) to see how uncertainty evolves as more data is added.

---

## üìù Reporting: Analysis and Insights

Your concise report (\~2 pages) should focus on clear insights, specifically:

* Plot how the **marginal likelihood (evidence)** surface changes with different values of length-scale ($\ell$).
* Discuss **over-fitting and under-fitting**: What happens when your length-scale is too small or too large?
* Clearly visualize how increasing data (n=5‚Üí30) reduces uncertainty and improves predictions.

---

## üöÄ Stretch Goals (Optional, Advanced)

If you're keen to deepen your understanding, consider:

* Exploring more complex kernels (Mat√©rn, periodic, etc.) and comparing their performance.
* Implementing automatic differentiation with `scipy.optimize` or other frameworks to efficiently optimize hyperparameters.

---

## üìö Resources and Support

* You‚Äôll receive a starter notebook with synthetic datasets to streamline the implementation and visualization process.
* Feel free to use external resources, lecture materials, and AI-assisted coding (clearly documented).

---

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

Gaussian Processes are widely used in industry and research due to their powerful predictive capabilities and robust uncertainty quantification:

* They are central in fields like geostatistics, finance, hyperparameter tuning, and Bayesian optimization.
* Understanding GP regression deeply enhances your practical skills in probabilistic modeling and optimization‚Äîessential competencies in modern machine learning.

This project will equip you with hands-on experience, enabling you to confidently apply GPs to real-world tasks and present an insightful portfolio piece.
