# Kernelized PCA

## üåü Motivation

Imagine you have data shaped like a spiral or a "Swiss-roll"‚Äîclearly non-linear, twisted, and curved. Ordinary PCA, as you've learned, excels at linear dimensionality reduction but will struggle with such nonlinear structures. What if we could extend PCA to discover the intrinsic, low-dimensional structure hidden within complex, nonlinear datasets?

**Kernelized PCA** is exactly the method we need:

* It cleverly uses **kernel methods** to implicitly map data into high-dimensional feature spaces, where nonlinear relationships become linear.
* Allows us to leverage PCA in that transformed space, giving us powerful nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
* Uncovers hidden structure and simplifies the representation of data, which can be critical for downstream tasks like classification, visualization, or clustering.

## üìå What You Will Do in This Project

Your main goal is clear and concrete:

> **Implement Kernelized PCA using an RBF kernel and apply it to the classic nonlinear ‚ÄúSwiss-roll‚Äù dataset.**

Specifically, you will:

* Construct and center the **kernel matrix** using an RBF kernel.
* Perform eigen-decomposition on the centered kernel matrix.
* Project the data onto the top-2 eigenvectors to visualize the intrinsic low-dimensional structure clearly.
* (Optionally) reconstruct original-space approximations ("pre-images") using kernel regression.

---

## üîç Key Concepts You'll Master

You'll gain practical experience with these fundamental concepts:

* **Kernel trick and nonlinear mapping**:
  How to implicitly represent nonlinear data in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicitly computing the mapping.

* **Centering the kernel matrix**:
  Why and how we need to center kernels in the implicit feature space.

* **Eigen-decomposition of kernels**:
  The theoretical connection between the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix and nonlinear principal components.

* **RBF kernel and hyperparameters**:
  Understanding the role of kernel width (Œ≥) in capturing data complexity and nonlinear structure.

---

## üöß Core Tasks (Implementation Details)

In practice, your workflow includes:

* **Constructing the Kernel Matrix**:
  Implement the RBF (Gaussian) kernel function, then compute and center the kernel matrix $K_c$.

* **Eigen-decomposition**:
  Extract eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the centered kernel matrix. Identify and use the top-2 eigenvectors to project your data into 2-D.

* **Visualization and Interpretation**:
  Produce clear scatter plots that demonstrate how KPCA captures the underlying nonlinear structure compared to linear PCA.

Optional but insightful:

* **Pre-image reconstruction**:
  Implement a simple kernel regression approach to approximate how the 2-D latent coordinates relate back to original data space.

## üìù Reporting: Analysis and Insights

Your short report (\~2 pages) should highlight clearly:

* **Linear PCA vs KPCA**:
  Compare scatter plots to illustrate how KPCA recovers meaningful nonlinear structure missed by standard PCA.

* **Role of Kernel Parameter (Œ≥)**:
  Discuss how varying Œ≥ influences the quality of dimensionality reduction and visualize this clearly.

* **Explained Variance**:
  Include a brief analysis of explained variance from eigenvalues, demonstrating how effectively KPCA compresses information.

---

## üöÄ Stretch Goals (Optional, Advanced)

To delve deeper, consider:

* Conducting a systematic **grid-search over Œ≥** and reporting how this affects the embedding quality and variance explained.
* Exploring alternate kernels (polynomial, sigmoid) and comparing their performance on nonlinear datasets.

---

## üìö Resources and Support

* You have access to provided datasets and basic visualization code to jumpstart your experimentation.
* You're encouraged to make use of external resources, lecture notes, and AI-assisted learning‚Äîclearly documented in your submission.

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

By mastering Kernelized PCA, you'll have:

* Practical insight into **kernel methods**‚Äîcrucial tools across machine learning.
* An intuitive understanding of nonlinear dimensionality reduction, directly applicable to problems in visualization, clustering, or preprocessing.
* An impressive and insightful component for your portfolio that demonstrates your ability to translate theory into clear, actionable implementation.
