# Convexity

**Convexity** is a term that pertains to both sets and functions. For
functions, there are different degrees of convexity, and how convex a
function is tells us a lot about its minima: do they exist, are they
unique, how quickly can we find them using optimization algorithms, etc.

In this section, we present basic results regarding convexity, strict
convexity, and strong convexity.
