## Vector spaces

**Vector spaces** are the basic setting in which linear algebra happens.
A vector space $V$ is a set (the elements of which are called
**vectors**) on which two operations are defined: vectors can be added
together, and vectors can be multiplied by real numbers called **scalars**.
$V$ must satisfy

(i) There exists an additive identity (written $\mathbf{0}$) in $V$ such
    that $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in V$

(ii) For each $\mathbf{x} \in V$, there exists an additive inverse
     (written $\mathbf{-x}$) such that
     $\mathbf{x}+(\mathbf{-x}) = \mathbf{0}$

(iii) There exists a multiplicative identity (written $1$) in
      $\mathbb{R}$ such that $1\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}$ for all
      $\mathbf{x} \in V$

(iv) Commutativity: $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{y}+\mathbf{x}$ for
     all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in V$

(v) Associativity:
    $(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y})+\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x}+(\mathbf{y}+\mathbf{z})$
    and $\alpha(\beta\mathbf{x}) = (\alpha\beta)\mathbf{x}$ for all
    $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z} \in V$ and
    $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$

(vi) Distributivity:
     $\alpha(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}) = \alpha\mathbf{x} + \alpha\mathbf{y}$
     and $(\alpha+\beta)\mathbf{x} = \alpha\mathbf{x} + \beta\mathbf{x}$
     for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in V$ and
     $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$

### Euclidean space

The quintessential vector space is **Euclidean space**, which we denote
$\mathbb{R}^n$. The vectors in this space consist of $n$-tuples of real
numbers:

$$\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$$

For our purposes, it
will be useful to think of them as $n \times 1$ matrices, or **column
vectors**:

$$\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n\end{bmatrix}$$

Addition and scalar multiplication are defined component-wise on vectors
in $\mathbb{R}^n$:

$$\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 + y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n + y_n\end{bmatrix}, \hspace{0.5cm} \alpha\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha x_1 \\ \vdots \\ \alpha x_n\end{bmatrix}$$

Euclidean space is used to mathematically represent physical space, with notions such as distance, length, and angles.
Although it becomes hard to visualize for $n > 3$, these concepts generalize mathematically in obvious ways. 
Even when you're working in more general settings than $\mathbb{R}^n$, it is often useful to visualize vector addition and scalar multiplication in terms of 2D vectors in the plane or 3D vectors in space.
