# Vectors and the Spaces they live in

In this chapter we present important classes of spaces in which our data will live and our operations will take place: 
vector spaces, metric spaces, normed spaces, and inner product spaces.
Generally speaking, these are defined in such a way as to capture one or more important properties of Euclidean space but in a more general way.
