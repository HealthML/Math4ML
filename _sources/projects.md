For the Math4ML Lecture the students will have to do somewhat advanced projects that require coding and build on the topics we did so far. The draft project titles are "Normalizing Flows with Coupling Layers", "Gaussian Mixture Models with  EM", "kernelized PCA", "Gaussian Processes with kernel Optimization", "Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models with input optimization", "Bayesian Logistic Regression with Variational Inference", "building an LBFGS optimizer". The students will have to provide a short description in a report and an implementation in python with numpy (adding pytorch for the Normalizing flows). I need short presentations and descriptions for each of the project topics. We can also refine them to make them more balanced and insightful. The idea is that this should make 40% of the final grade. The students should be able to do this with about 20h of work. It is open source and I think they can use AI at home.
