# Mean Value Theorem for Parabolic Approximation
If $f$ is twice continuously differentiable, then

$$f(\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{h}) \approx f(\mathbf{x}_0) + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)^\top\mathbf{h} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{h}^\top\nabla^2f(\mathbf{x}_0)\mathbf{h}$$

is a parabolic approximation to $f$ that has the same Gradient and Hessian as $f$ at $\mathbf{x}_0$.
