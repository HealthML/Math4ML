# Overview of Machine Learning Concepts

Broadly speaking, Machine Learning (ML) can be categorized into two main areas: **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning. This chapter provides a brief introduction to these concepts and introduces the notation used throughout the book.

In **supervised learning**, we have labeled data, meaning each data point comes with an associated "label" or "target" that we aim to predict. The goal is to learn a mathematical model that accurately predicts these labels for new, unseen data. Supervised learning tasks include:

- **Classification:** Predict discrete categories or classes, such as distinguishing benign from malignant tumors.
- **Regression:** Predict continuous numeric outcomes, like temperatures or house prices.

Both classification and regression techniques heavily rely on linear algebra, optimization, and probabilistic methods explored in subsequent chapters.

In **unsupervised learning**, our dataset lacks explicit labels. Instead, the objective is to identify underlying patterns or structures directly from the data. Key areas include:

- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without prior labels, leveraging concepts from metric spaces and distances.
- **Representation Learning (Dimensionality Reduction):** Reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data while preserving important structural information, relying on linear algebra techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

In this chapter, you will gain a clear overview of these fundamental machine learning tasks, preparing you to appreciate the mathematical foundations explored throughout the rest of the book.
