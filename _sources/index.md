# Mathematics for Machine Learning

Machine learning uses tools from a variety of mathematical fields.

Our assumption is that the reader is already familiar with the basic concepts of multivariable calculus, linear algebra and probability theory (at the level of Mathematik 2 and Mathematik 3 in the ITSE Bachelor).

This script is based on the Mathematics for Machine Learning scripts at UC Berkeley that can be found at [math4ml](https://github.com/gwthomas/math4ml).
