### Line Search

#### Line Search Types

##### exact line search: 
$t=\operatorname{argmin}_{t>0} f(x+t \Delta x)$

##### backtracking line search
(with parameters $\alpha\in(0,1/2), \beta\in(0,1)$)
- starting at $t=1$, repeat $t:=\beta t$ until

$$f(x+t\Delta x)<f(x) + \alpha t\nabla f(x)^\top \Delta x$$

- graphical interpretation: backtrack until $t\leq t_0$

#### Inexact line search
In the unconstrained minimization problem, the **Wolfe conditions** are a set of inequalities for performing *inexact line search*, especially in quasi-Newton methods.

Each step often involves approximately solving the subproblem

$$\min_{\alpha} f(\mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \Delta_k)$$

where $\mathbf{x}_k$ is the current best guess, $\Delta_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a search direction, and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ is the step length.

The inexact line searches provide an efficient way of computing an acceptable step length $\alpha$ that reduces $f$ \emph{sufficiently}.

A line search algorithm can use **Wolfe conditions** as a requirement for any guessed $\alpha$, before finding a new search direction $\Delta_k$.

A step length $\alpha_k$ is said to satisfy the **Wolfe conditions**, restricted to the direction $\Delta_k$, if the following two inequalities hold:


i)  $f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\Delta_k)\leq f(\mathbf{x}_k) + c_1\alpha_k \Delta_k^{\mathrm T} \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)$

ii)  $-\Delta_k^\top\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\Delta_k) \leq -c_2\Delta_k^\top\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants in $(0,1)$, i.e., $0<c_1<c_2<1$.


(In examining condition (ii), recall that to ensure that $\Delta_k$ is a descent direction, we have $\Delta_k^\top\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) < 0$.)

$c_1$ is usually chosen to be quite small while $c_2$ is much larger;

Denote a univariate function $\varphi$ restricted to the direction $\Delta_k$ as $\varphi(\alpha)=f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha\Delta_k)$. 

The Wolfe conditions can result in a value for the step length that is not close to a minimizer of $\varphi$. 

If we modify the curvature condition to the following,

$$ \textbf{iii)} \quad \big|\Delta_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k+\alpha_k\Delta_k)\big|\leq c_2\big|\Delta_k^{\mathrm T}\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\big|$$

then i) and iii) together form the so-called \term{strong Wolfe conditions}, and force $\alpha_k$ to lie close to a **critical point** of $\varphi$.

Rationale:

The principal reason for imposing the Wolfe conditions in an optimization algorithm where  $\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \Delta_k$ is to ensure convergence of the gradient to zero.  

In particular, if the cosine of the angle between $\Delta_k$ and the gradient,

$$\cos \theta_k = \frac {\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)^{\mathrm T}\Delta_k }{\| \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\| \|\Delta_k\| } $$

is bounded away from zero and the i) and ii) conditions hold, then $\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) \rightarrow 0$.
