# The fundamental subspaces of a matrix

The fundamental subspaces of a matrix $A$ are the four subspaces associated with the matrix and its transpose. These subspaces are important in linear algebra and numerical analysis, particularly in the context of solving linear systems and eigenvalue problems.

1. **Column Space (Range) of A**: The column space of a matrix $A$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of its columns. It represents the span of the columns of $A$ and is denoted as $\text{Col}(A)$ or $\text{Range}(A)$.

2. **Null Space (Kernel) of A**: The null space of a matrix $A$ is the set of all vectors $\mathbf{x}$ such that $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. It represents the solutions to the homogeneous equation associated with $A$ and is denoted as $\text{Null}(A)$ or $\text{Ker}(A)$.

3. **Row Space of A**: The row space of a matrix $A$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of its rows. It is equivalent to the column space of its transpose, $A^\top$, and is denoted as $\text{Row}(A)$ or $\text{Col}(A^\top)$.

4. **Left Null Space (Kernel) of A**: The left null space of a matrix $A$ is the set of all vectors $\mathbf{y}$ such that $A^\top\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$. It represents the solutions to the homogeneous equation associated with $A^\top$ and is denoted as $\text{Null}(A^\top)$ or $\text{Ker}(A^\top)$.
